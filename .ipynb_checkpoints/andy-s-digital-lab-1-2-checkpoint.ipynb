This could be because you are collaborating on a project, you have taken over maintenance of an existing codebase, or you are learning new syntax or skills that require reading example codes. Comprehending code written by someone else is a distinct skill from being able to write your own code, and it takes practice to become proficient at it.</p>\r\n<p>Reading unfamiliar code is like exploring an unfamiliar city without a map or a guide. Just like in a new city, you may not know where to start or how to navigate the codebase. You may encounter unfamiliar syntax, functions, and libraries that you have never seen before, just as you might encounter new streets, buildings, and landmarks. At first, you may feel disoriented and overwhelmed, and may need to spend some time getting oriented and familiarizing yourself with the environment. As you explore, you may start to see patterns and similarities, just as you might begin to recognize neighborhoods and landmarks in a new city. You may also encounter dead-ends, confusing intersections, and unexpected detours, just as you might encounter bugs and errors in the code.</p><p>To make progress in this unfamiliar territory, you may need to rely on a combination of intuition, deduction, and experimentation. You may need to break down the code into smaller pieces, analyze the behavior of each piece, and gradually build up a mental model of how the code works. You may also need to consult documentation, online resources, or other experts who are familiar with the codebase, just as you might ask locals or consult a map in a new city.</p>\r\n<p>In the end, with patience, persistence, and a willingness to learn, you can successfully navigate the unfamiliar code and achieve your goals, just as you can successfully explore a new city and discover its hidden treasures. Learning how to read and understand code written by someone else is a valuable skill that can help you be a more effective programmer. By being able to read and comprehend unfamiliar code, you can contribute to projects more quickly, diagnose and fix bugs more effectively, and learn new programming techniques and best practices.
